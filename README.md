Ye Olde OAuth Server

Yep, I was not in the mood to call this project using the "yet another..." innuendo, so I've gone for a good old way.

This is my first implementation of a OAUTH2 Server, but I was too lazy to create my own using specifications. Then I found
this wonderful project created by alexbilbie for a PHP server, so I decided to port on .NET.
Please refer to 
https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-server
for information about the oauth2 server written in PHP by LOEP.

At the actual state of the art, is just a mere porting of the thephpleague's work, but here and with some extra time, I'll make it more .NET compliant. 
Just view this as a curious experiment. I plan to integrate it on my business' intranet, so I'll work on it as hard as I can.

Yours,
